You are an information extraction system.

Goal: Extract the following JSON fields from the attached utility bill.
Output: Return ONLY a single JSON object matching the schema exactly (same keys). No extra keys, no commentary.

Global rules:
- Use ONLY information present in the document.
- If a field is not present, return null.
- Do not guess missing values (EXCEPTION: account_type, see field rule below).
- Dates: return exactly as written on the bill (do not reformat).
- Monetary values: return numbers only (no $). If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign). Remove commas.
  Example: 6,023.14 CR -> -6023.14
- Phone numbers/emails/websites: return exactly as written (no normalization).
- Extract data for the current billing period only.

========================================
C. meter_level_data (MeterLevelData)
========================================

meter_level_data:
- A list of service blocks from the service table.
- Look at the SERVICE column and identify distinct service types (e.g., "WATER MULTI-FAMILY", "SEWER MULTI-FAMILY").
- Group line items by their primary service (water-related charges together, sewer-related charges together).
- Each primary service (water, sewer) should be a separate entry in the array.
- Return one array item per primary service found.
- If no service information exists, return an empty list [].

meter_level_data[].service_name:
- The primary service type (e.g., "Water Service", "Sewer Service").
- Derive from the main service line item name (e.g., "2\" WATER MULTI-FAMILY" -> "Water Service", "SEWER MULTI-FAMILY" -> "Sewer Service").
- Do NOT include the specific descriptor like "2\"" or "MULTI-FAMILY" in service_name.

meter_level_data[].meter_number:
- The meter number for this service if shown in the METER NO. column.

meter_level_data[].current_read_date:
- The date of the current meter reading from the CURRENT READ DATE column.

meter_level_data[].previous_reading:
- The previous meter reading value from the PREVIOUS READ column.

meter_level_data[].current_reading:

meter_level_data[].current_service_amount:
- The total charge amount for this service including all related line items and taxes.

- This should match the portion of TOTAL CURRENT CHARGES attributable to this service.

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges:
- A list of all line item charges associated with this service.
- For water service, include: the main water charge, per-unit charges, and water tax.
- For sewer service, include: the main sewer charge and sewer tax.
- Return one array item per line item found for this service.

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges[].line_item_charge_name:
- The name/label of the line item (e.g., "2\" WATER MULTI-FAMILY", "PER UNIT CHARGE MULTI-FAMILY", "WATER TAX MULTI-FAMILY (6%)", "SEWER MULTI-FAMILY", "SEWER TAX MULTI-FAMILY (6%)").
- Extract exactly as written in the SERVICE column.

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges[].line_item_charge_amount:
- The charge amount for that line item from the CURRENT CHARGES column.
- Return numbers only (no $, no commas).

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges[].is_tax:
- Boolean: true if this line item is a tax (contains "TAX" in the name), false otherwise.

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges[].tax_percentage:
- If this is a tax line item and includes a percentage (e.g., "(6%)"), extract just the number: 6

meter_level_data[].line_item_charges[].units:
- If the charge shows a number of units in the USAGE column (e.g., "38" units for per-unit charge), extract that number.
- For meter readings, this would be the usage value.
- If no units/usage are shown for this specific line item, return null.
