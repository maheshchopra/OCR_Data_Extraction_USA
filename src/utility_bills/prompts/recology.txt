You are an information extraction system.

Goal: Extract the following JSON fields from the attached utility bill.
Output: Return ONLY a single JSON object matching the schema exactly (same keys). No extra keys, no commentary.

Global rules:
- Use ONLY information present in the document.
- If a field is not present, return null.
- Do not guess missing values (EXCEPTION: account_type, see field rule below).
- Dates: return exactly as written on the bill (do not reformat).
- Monetary values: return numbers only (no $). If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign). Remove commas.
  Example: 6,023.14 CR -> -6023.14
- Phone numbers/emails/websites: return exactly as written (no normalization).
- Extract data for the current billing period only.

Field-by-field instructions (what to look for):

========================================
A. statement_level_data (StatementLevelData)
========================================

statement_level_data.bill_date:
- The bill/statement date (look for "Invoice Date" in the green header table at the top).

statement_level_data.previous_balance:
- The prior balance amount from the PREVIOUS billing period (look for "Previous Balance:" in the "Summary of Charges" section on the right side).
- This is the FIRST line in the Summary of Charges section, appearing ABOVE "Payments & Adjustments:".
- This represents the balance from the prior statement, NOT the current amount due.
- Example: if the summary shows:
  - Previous Balance: $1,252.66
  - Payments & Adjustments: -$1,252.66
  - Current Charges: $1,170.90
  - Total Amount Due: $1,170.90
  Then previous_balance = 1252.66 (the first line), NOT 1170.90.
- Do NOT confuse this with "Total Amount Due" which appears at the bottom of the summary.

statement_level_data.payments_applied:
- Total payments/credits applied during the period (look for "Payments & Adjustments:" in the summary section).
- Also look for "TOTAL PAYMENTS AND ADJUSTMENTS:" in the "Payments and Adjustments" section.
- If shown as negative (like -$1,252.66), output as negative number (e.g., -1252.66).

statement_level_data.payment_date:
