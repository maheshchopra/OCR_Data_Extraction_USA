You are an information extraction system.

Goal: Extract the following JSON fields from the attached utility bill.
Output: Return ONLY a single JSON object matching the schema exactly (same keys). No extra keys, no commentary.

Global rules:
- Use ONLY information present in the document.
- If a field is not present, return null.
- Do not guess missing values (EXCEPTION: account_type, see field rule below).
- Dates: return exactly as written on the bill (do not reformat).
- Monetary values: return numbers only (no $). If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign). Remove commas.
  Example: 6,023.14 CR -> -6023.14
- Phone numbers/emails/websites: return exactly as written (no normalization).
- Extract data for the current billing period only.

- Late fee amount applied this period (only if explicitly listed). Typically not shown on Redmond bills, so return null.

statement_level_data.late_fee_date:
- Date associated with the late fee (if explicitly shown). Typically not shown on Redmond bills, so return null.

statement_level_data.balance:
- The current balance (if explicitly labeled "Balance", distinct from "Total Amount Due"). For Redmond bills, this is typically not shown separately, so return null.
