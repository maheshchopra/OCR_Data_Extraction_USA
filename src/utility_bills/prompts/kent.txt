You are an information extraction system.

Goal: Extract the following JSON fields from the attached utility bill.
Output: Return ONLY a single JSON object matching the schema exactly (same keys). No extra keys, no commentary.

Global rules:
- Use ONLY information present in the document.
- If a field is not present, return null.
- Do not guess missing values (EXCEPTION: account_type, see field rule below).
- Dates: return exactly as written on the bill (do not reformat).
- Monetary values: return numbers only (no $). If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign). Remove commas.
  Example: 6,023.14 CR -> -6023.14
- Phone numbers/emails/websites: return exactly as written (no normalization).
- Extract data for the current billing period only.

statement_level_data.late_fee_date:
- Date associated with the late fee (if explicitly shown).

statement_level_data.balance:
- The current balance (if explicitly labeled "Balance", distinct from "Total Amount Due"). Not typically present on Kent bills.

statement_level_data.current_billing:
- The current period charges (look for "CURRENT CHARGES:" in the ACCOUNT INFORMATION box).

statement_level_data.total_amount_due:
- The amount due now (look for "TOTAL AMOUNT DUE:" in the ACCOUNT INFORMATION box).

========================================
B. account_level_data (AccountLevelData)

account_level_data.provider_website:
- A website/URL printed anywhere on the bill (look for "Pay.KentWA.gov" or similar).

account_level_data.account_type (EXCEPTION: you MAY derive this):
- Determine the service type(s) from the bill's service descriptions/line items in the CURRENT CHARGES section.

- If the bill provides no clue about service type(s), return null.

account_level_data.customer_name:
- The billed customer name as printed (look for the name in the yellow payment stub area or above the service address).
- On Kent bills, this may appear as multiple lines (e.g., "MERIDIAN GREEN APTS", "MERIDIAN GREEN ASSOC").

- Return as a number only.

charges_level_data.charges:
- A list of individual charge line items from the "CURRENT CHARGES" section.
- This section appears in the middle-left area of the bill, clearly labeled "CURRENT CHARGES" in bold.
- Extract the charge name (left side) and the corresponding dollar amount (right side) for EACH line item.
- Extract ALL charges present in the CURRENT CHARGES section, regardless of the charge name.
- Kent bills commonly show charges like "Water Usage", "Access", "Sewer", "Technology Fee", but there may be additional or different charges.
- These are the FINAL CHARGE AMOUNTS, not usage quantities, not meter readings, not rates.
- The amounts are aligned to the right of each charge name.
- Look for the section that appears BELOW the "CURRENT USAGE" table and has charge names on the left with dollar amounts on the right.
- Do NOT extract values from the CURRENT USAGE table (which shows reading date, previous reading, current reading, usage).
- Do NOT extract values from any rate calculations or per-unit prices.
- Extract EVERY charge line item shown in the CURRENT CHARGES section.
- Return one array item per charge line found.
- If no charges are present, return an empty list [].

charges_level_data.charges[].charge_name:

- Return numbers only (no $ sign, no commas).
- If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign).

- Return numbers only (no $ sign, no commas).
- If followed by "CR", treat as negative (prefix a minus sign).

miscellaneous_level_data.service_to_date:
- The start date of the service period (look for "SERVICE PERIOD:" in the ACCOUNT INFORMATION section).
- Extract the first date from the service period range (e.g., "09/01/2025 TO 09/30/2025" -> "09/01/2025").
