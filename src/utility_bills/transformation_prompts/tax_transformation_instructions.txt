SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAX HANDLING:

Taxes MUST be placed in the "taxes" array within service_level_data, NOT in charge_groups.

How to identify taxes:
- Line item charges with "Tax" in the name (e.g., "Effect of Seattle City Tax", "State Utility Tax")
- Line item charges with percentage rates (e.g., "6.714%", "3.852%")
- Common tax names: City Tax, State Tax, Utility Tax, Sales Tax, etc.

When you find a tax in the source data:
1. DO NOT add it to charge_groups
2. DO NOT create a charge_group with group_name "Taxes"
3. Instead, add it to the "taxes" array using the Tax model structure

Tax model structure:
{
  "tax_name": "string",           // e.g., "Seattle City Tax"
  "tax_authority": "string",      // e.g., "City of Seattle" or "Washington State"
  "rate": float,                  // e.g., 6.714 (percentage as decimal, no % sign)
  "taxable_amount": float,        // The amount being taxed (if shown)
  "tax_amount": float            // The actual tax amount charged
}

Examples:

Source: "Effect of Seattle City Tax" with rate "6.714%" and charge amount $124.92
→ Add to taxes array:
{
  "tax_name": "Seattle City Tax",
  "tax_authority": "City of Seattle",
  "rate": 6.714,
  "taxable_amount": null,  // if not explicitly shown
  "tax_amount": 124.92
}

Source: "State Utility Tax" with rate "3.852%" and no charge amount shown
→ Add to taxes array:
{
  "tax_name": "State Utility Tax",
  "tax_authority": "Washington State",
  "rate": 3.852,
  "taxable_amount": null,
  "tax_amount": null
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- If a line item contains "Tax" in its name, it goes in "taxes", NOT in "charge_groups"
- The "taxes" array should contain ALL tax entries from the bill
- charge_groups should contain charges and credits but NEVER taxes
- Extract tax authority from context (city name, state name, etc.) or set to ""
